# Remove Middle Man

## Ref: https://refactoring.guru/remove-middle-man

## Problem

A class has too many methods that simply delegate to other objects.

## Solution

Delete these methods and force the client to call the end methods directly.

## Why Refactor

1. The server-class doesnâ€™t do anything itself and simply creates needless complexity. In this case, give thought to whether this class is needed at all.
2. Every time a new feature is added to the delegate, you need to create a delegating method for it in the server-class. If a lot of changes are made, this will be rather tiresome.

## How to Refactor

1. Create a getter for accessing the delegate-class object from the server-class object.
2. Replace calls to delegating methods in the server-class with direct calls for methods in the delegate-class.
